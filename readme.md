# Personal Guides

This is a repository of my own guides to setting up my own workspace and programs.

## Guide Rules

For any guide to be submitted here, the guide:
* **Must** follow the guide template located *here*.
* **Must** be in its own directory, and that directory's name **must** concisely describe the guide it contains.
* **Must** be in its proper category directory.
  * Setup guides **must** be found in the `setup` directory.
  * Tutorials **must** be found in the `tutorial` directory.
  * Troubleshooting guides **must** be found in the `troubleshooting` directory.
  * Guides that might not necessarily fall in the aforementioned categories **must** specify their own generalized category.
* **Must** bear a filename of `readme.md`.
* **Must** be submitted through a *Pull Request*. This implies that the guide **must** come from a branch and should be scheduled to merge onto `master`.
* **Must not** contain any author or historical information; this repository already covers such metadata through `git` commits.
