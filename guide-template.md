# Guide Template

This document bears the template to use when writing guides in this repository.

## Guidelines

* Always list a complete "*happy path*" iteration of steps before listing any exceptional situations and steps; list exceptional steps in different sections. This is to ensure that the reader does not unnecessarily worry about steps they would not likely come across when completing the "*happy path*" iteration.
* Provide screenshots as necessary; the image files should reside in the same directory as the guide itself for easy reference.
*

*End of document; the actual template is below.*
